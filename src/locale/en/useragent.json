It can either do this by storing a unique id as the user info of the contact_uri or by storing it as a contact parameter for REGISTER. Mid_dialog states are also stored using the contact parameters. If the value is set to false, Karoo will insert a record route header instead.  If your switch/pbx supports parameters in contact, enabling this is recommended.",
